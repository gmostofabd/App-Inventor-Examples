App Inventor is an open-source programming environment which allows beginner coders to build their own fully functional apps for Android Operating System.

It is composed of a “designer” section where you visually design your app layout and a “blocks” sections where you include the code to run your app.

To use this program, you just need a gmail address. Then click here and click on “Create apps!” on the top to log in.

## **🛠️ How to Use App Inventor**

Follow this step-by-step guide to get started with **MIT App Inventor** and begin building your own apps!

### **Step 1: Set Up MIT App Inventor**
1. Visit the official website: [**MIT App Inventor**](http://appinventor.mit.edu/).
2. Click on **Create Apps!** to open the App Inventor development environment.
3. Log in using your **Google account** to access the app creation dashboard.

### **Step 2: Create a New Project**
1. On the main dashboard, click **Start New Project**.
2. Enter a project name, like `MyFirstApp`, and click **OK**.
3. You’ll be taken to the project workspace, where you can design your app.

### **Step 3: Design the User Interface (UI)**
1. **In the Designer tab**, drag and drop components (e.g., buttons, text boxes, images) from the **Palette** on the left into the **Viewer**.
2. Customize each component’s properties (e.g., text, color, size) using the **Properties panel** on the right.

### **Step 4: Add Functionality with Blocks**
1. Switch to the **Blocks** tab to create the logic behind your app.
2. Drag blocks like `When Button1.Click` from the component list and add **logic** or **control blocks** to perform actions such as changing text, displaying notifications, or interacting with hardware.

   *Block-based coding interface*  

### **Step 5: Connect Your Device**
1. **Live Testing**: Test your app on a real device using the **MIT AI2 Companion** app:
   - Download the [**MIT AI2 Companion**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3) from the Play Store.
   - Open the app, and in App Inventor, go to **Connect** → **AI Companion**.
   - Scan the displayed **QR code** or enter the code to sync your device for live testing.

2. **Emulator**: Alternatively, use the built-in emulator by clicking **Connect** → **Emulator**.

### **Step 6: Build and Test the App**
1. To export your app as an installable APK, click **Build** → **App (save .apk to my computer)**.
2. Once the APK is generated, download and install it on any Android device.

> 🎉 **Tip**: You can use **AI-powered cloud services** like **Firebase** for **real-time data** synchronization.
